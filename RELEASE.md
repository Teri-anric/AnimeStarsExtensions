# AnimeStar Extension v0.0.27

## Overview
This release adds club-only card statistics (need/owner/trade) for widgets and templates, fixed boost-club auto limit detection from the page, and fixed duplicate-card counting.

## Changes

### User-facing

- **Club stats on cards**: Instantly shows how many club members need, own, or want to trade a card — right inside widgets and templates.
- **Boost club now stops at your true limit**: Fixed auto boost so it correctly reads your daily limit from the progress bar and always stops when you reach that limit.
- **Duplicate count fixed**: Fixed duplicate card counting — before, the number could be twice as high as what you actually had; now it always shows the real number of duplicates you own.
