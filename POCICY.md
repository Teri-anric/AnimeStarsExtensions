### Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: 03.03.2025**

We, the developers of the **AnimeStar Extension**, take your privacy seriously. This privacy policy outlines how we collect, use, store, and protect your information while using our extension.

**1. Information Collection**  
We collect the following types of information to improve our extension:

**1.1 Anonymous Usage Data:**
- Extension feature usage statistics (which features are used and how often)
- Page view events on AnimeStar websites
- Extension performance metrics and error reports
- Extension version and browser information

**1.2 Telemetry Data:**
- **Machine ID**: A unique identifier generated locally to distinguish different installations without identifying individuals
- **Username**: Your AnimeStar username (extracted from page content when available)
- **Club ID**: Your AnimeStar club affiliation ID (when available on the page)
- **Page URLs**: URLs of pages where the extension is active (limited to AnimeStar domains)
- **Timestamps**: When events and interactions occur
- **Feature Usage**: Which extension features are activated and used

**Important**: We do NOT collect personal information such as email addresses, passwords, browsing history outside AnimeStar sites, or any data that could personally identify you beyond your public AnimeStar username.

**2. Use of Information**  
The collected telemetry data is used exclusively to:
- Analyze extension usage patterns to prioritize feature development
- Identify and fix bugs or performance issues
- Measure the effectiveness of new features
- Generate anonymous usage statistics for development planning
- Provide technical support when users report issues

We do not use your information for advertising, marketing to third parties, or any commercial purposes beyond improving the extension.

**3. Information Storage and Security**  
**3.1 Local Storage:**
- All telemetry events are initially stored locally on your device using browser storage APIs
- Local data is automatically cleaned up after 30 days
- You can clear all local telemetry data at any time through the extension settings

**3.2 Server Storage:**
- Telemetry data may be sent to secure servers in batches for analysis
- All data transmission uses encrypted HTTPS connections
- Server-side data is anonymized and aggregated for statistical analysis
- Individual user activities cannot be traced back to specific users

**3.3 Data Retention:**
- Server-side telemetry data is retained for a maximum of 12 months
- Data older than 12 months is automatically deleted
- Aggregated statistics may be retained longer but contain no identifiable information

**4. Telemetry Control Options**  
You have full control over telemetry collection:
- **Opt-out**: Telemetry collection can be completely disabled in extension settings
- **Data Deletion**: You can request deletion of all your telemetry data at any time
- **Transparency**: You can view what data has been collected through the extension interface
- **Granular Control**: Future updates may provide options to disable specific types of data collection

**5. Information Disclosure**  
We do not share, sell, or disclose your telemetry data to third parties, except:
- When required by law or legal process
- To protect our rights or the safety of users
- In anonymized, aggregated form for research or development purposes
- With service providers who assist in data processing (under strict confidentiality agreements)

**6. Security**  
We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data:
- Encrypted data transmission (HTTPS/TLS)
- Secure server infrastructure with access controls
- Regular security audits and updates
- Data minimization practices (collecting only necessary data)
- Automatic data expiration and cleanup

However, no method of data transmission or storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

**7. Changes to the Privacy Policy**  
We may periodically update this privacy policy to reflect changes in our data practices or legal requirements. Any changes will be posted on this page with the date of the last update indicated. Significant changes will be communicated through the extension update notifications.

You have the right to:
- Know what data we collect about you
- Access your telemetry data
- Request deletion of your data
- Opt-out of data collection at any time
- Receive a copy of your data in a readable format

**9. Contact Information**  
If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this privacy policy or your data, please contact us at: [2005ahi2005@gmail.com]

For telemetry-specific questions or data deletion requests, please include "Telemetry" in your email subject line.

**10. Compliance**  
This extension and its data practices are designed to comply with applicable privacy laws, including GDPR and similar regulations. We treat all users' privacy with the same high standards regardless of location.
